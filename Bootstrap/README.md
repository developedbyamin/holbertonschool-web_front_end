# Bootstrap Usage Guide

## Introduction

This README.md file serves as a guide for using Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework for building responsive and mobile-first websites.

## Getting Started

To start using Bootstrap, you have several options:

1. **Download**: You can download Bootstrap directly from the official website: [getbootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com/). This is suitable for projects where you want full control over the source files.

2. **CDN**: You can include Bootstrap via a CDN (Content Delivery Network) by adding the following line to your HTML file:

    ```html
    <link href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/5.1.3/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
    ```

    This method is convenient for quick prototyping or if you prefer not to host Bootstrap yourself.

3. **Package Managers**: If you're using package managers like npm or yarn, you can install Bootstrap using the following commands:

    ```bash
    npm install bootstrap
    ```
